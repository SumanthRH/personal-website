      Working on the LLM team at Anyscale wearing many hats - working on new fine-tuning features, performance improvements, product CLI/SDK, etc
      * Added support for different fine-tuning tasks (such as instruction tuning and causal LM) training as well as function-calling fine-tuning.
      * Improved model support to allow bringing any HuggingFace model with any chat template to fine-tune on Anyscale.
      * Led building the [LLM Models SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/llms/finetuning/guides/models_sdk_demo) for easily going from fine-tuning to serving on the platform.

      Worked on the Generative AI team at C3!
      * Set up a finetuning codebase from scratch for C3's Generative Search application
      * Features: Support for difference causal and sequence-2-sequence models, ability to mix different training datasets (for a text-to-text or a causal language modelling task), visualize metrics on multiple evaluation datasets, etc
      * Trained 10B+ parameter models on 1M+ samples using DeepSpeed and ðŸ¤— Accelerate.

      This was a part time internship I did with Hakimo in Spring'23. This was my first time working on video-based models, so that was fun! 
        * Worked on video-based object detection models for Hakimo's Remote Guarding Solution
        * Trained 3D ResNets on Hakimo's video surviellance data and experimented with single and muli-pathway SlowFast networks.

      Bachelor's [Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dAyPzvIj7AUP-VrUPmmzvKc49P7VnXxM/view).
         
        * Demonstrated fast reconstruction of a 12 frame video from a single image of a lensless camera, 
          reducing inference time from 2 hours to 30 milliseconds.
        * Proposed an efficient reconstruction framework - a physics-aware neural net  
          trained in an adversarial fashion, used feature-based loss for photorealism.
        * Employed a trainable inversion layer to reverse the forward process of the camera, 
          along with a UNet for perceptual enhancement.
