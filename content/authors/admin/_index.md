I'm a software engineer at Anyscale. My primary interests are broadly in machine learning. I'm an avid reader and spend my free time reading and learning about a bunch of different topics, from psychology and finance to cryptocurrency and machine learning! I have a keen interest in startups and the future of software! Lately, like a lot of people, I've been trying to make sense of language models. 

Previously, I completed my master's in computer science at UC San Diego. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree (Hons.) in Electical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
