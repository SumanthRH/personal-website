title: Image Restoration for Under-Display Cameras
summary: We created a novel deep learning based model for image restoration, resulting in a publication at ECCV Workshops 2020. We also placed 2nd /150 teams at the Under Display Camera Challenge. This was a really fun project where I also got to talk about our work for the first time!
