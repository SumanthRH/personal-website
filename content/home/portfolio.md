      Working on the LLM team at Anyscale wearing many hats - working on new fine-tuning features, performance improvements, product CLI/SDK, etc
      * Added support for different fine-tuning tasks (such as instruction tuning and causal LM) training as well as function-calling fine-tuning.
      * Improved model support to allow bringing any HuggingFace model with any chat template to fine-tune on Anyscale.
      * Led building the [LLM Models SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/llms/finetuning/guides/models_sdk_demo) for easily going from fine-tuning to serving on the platform.
