I've been trying to patch together what the right way of consuming information is in the current age. Each year the amount of information thrown at you grows more and more indigestable. I've got a new model:

Only the Best

Whether it;s a podcast, TV series or a movie, I simply cannot be bothered to listen/watch the latest hot garbage. I think there's so much good content out there I better rewatch the best rather than finish the new. I was recently listening to Joe Rogan and Marc Andreesen and the amount of information density was unbelievable. Joe Rogan,'s breadth and deptth of knowledge, whether you love him or hate him, is now among the smartest people in the world, which makes sense given what he's been doing over so many years - If there was one shortcut to become knowledgeable, it would be to have 3 hour conversations with the smartest people in the world every week, where you're  actively listening and tyring to get to the bottom of everything. Even a casual conversation with fellow comedians on his podcast can surprise me sometimes with how he thinks. Anyways, the point is, you're better off rewatching Dunkirk or Dark Knight Rises than watching the next installment in Marvel's shitty universe.
