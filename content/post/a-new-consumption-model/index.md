I've been trying to patch together what the right way of consuming media is the current age. Or rather, right now in 2022, since this stuff changes so fast it's hard to think through what things will look like in 5 years. Each year the amount of information thrown at me has grown more and more incomprehensible. Now, I'm way more of a digital recluse than most people, and I have fortunately escaped the need to use many social media sites like Facebook or Instagram (till now). Here's what my sources look like right now:

* *YouTube*: more fun than educational. My feed is usually filled with fitness videos, some stand-up comedy and podcast clips. I have unfortunately started watching YouTube shorts more and more these past months, which I'm trying to avoid. There's always the occasional rabbit hole I dive into, when my feed changes drastically for a week or so. This is more or less random, with a mix of past passions re-emerging (I recently watched 18 hours of God of War Ragnarok gameplay because, yeah...) and passing trends (I watched wayy too many clips about WallStreetBets "degenerates" blowing all their money on GameStop in 2021).  
* *Twitter*: Tech-related content. I use Twitter every day to get to know a little bit about what's happening in the world of startups, machine learning, crypto, etc. It took me some time to figure out how to end mindless scrolling on the site. I stopped following people and started using Twitter Lists to bucket different accounts into a topic of interest. Made things much simpler, and I didn't have use for the Home feed anymore. In 2022 Twitter seems to have added a lot more recommended content on the home feed though, and it seems...pretty good, actually. 
* *Google News*: News. This has usually turned out to be more of a distraction than useful till now.
* *Newsletters:* I like to use Morning Bew for a quick short summary of what's happening (in the U.S ). I'm also subscribed to Benedict Evans' newsletter and Stratechery, by Ben Thompson, which I read much less than I want to. 
* *Podcasts:*  I listen to podcasts as well, maybe once a week or so. I don't know enough about the space yet, but I do listen to some Joe Rogan, Andrew Huberman and the All-in Podcast. I was recently listening to Joe Rogan and Marc Andreesen and the information density was..... unbelievable. There may be a number of things you can disagree with Joe Rogan on, but there are few very people who get to have 3 hour conversations with people like Mark Zuckerberg, Naval Ravikant and Marc Andreesen.



**Only the Best**

Whether it's a podcast, TV series or a movie, I simply shouldn't be bothered to listen to/watch the latest hot garbage. I think there's so much good content out there right now that it's better to rewatch the best rather than finish the new. Anyways, the point is, you're better off rewatching Dunkirk or Dark Knight Rises than watching Phase 24 Marvel movies.
