Personal Website, build on top of [WowChemy](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/)

I've been trying to find ways to I can build my website, having as much customizability as I want while also having as little friction as possible. I started from the basics and tried Jekyll-now, realized that the it was *too flexible* and then went all the way to the other extreme with Squarespace - which I found to be _too rigid_. I'm now trying Wowchemy and it hasn't disappointed me yet. I've had to quickly brush up on CSS and HTML as well, so that's been fun!
